# ConfessCoercion
confess your feeling to your boyfriend and it will ensure that he said "yes!" psst! you could edit and make this for everything! run it fast on python anywhere! and actually this is pop up version, but i make the web version one, if you guys want to try it online
i make this to courage my bestfriend, She said that she failed to express her feelings to someone she likes, I couldn't help much and just tried to comfort her <3 

This is the umpteenth project I've made with python, the thing that gave me the most difficulty was deploying it, this is my first time deploying with python, it's very difficult, because I've never done that before, so I've included a video if you want to see how it works without having to do a git clone!
